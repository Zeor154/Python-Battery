3. time

# Python version
My python version Python 3.9. It's needed to compile the script. I compile the script using auto-py-to-exe python module.
# Permissions
This app doesn't need unused permissions.
# Changes that I couldn't add
1. Sleep when the battery is below 15%
2. A GUI so it's easier to set the settings.

If anyone could fix this, just create a new pull requests and I'll review it. Thanks!
